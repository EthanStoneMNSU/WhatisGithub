# Where is github?

On a somewhat serious note I'm curious as to if there's any popular 3rd party programs that interact with Github.
There's Git and Github Desktop which are great and I'm pretty sure they're locally sourced. 
My question is if there's any good 3rd party applications that use Github just to explore more about the broader spectrum.
